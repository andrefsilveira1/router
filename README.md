# Router - Chip

This repository contains an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and an small structure for graphs. Later, an implementation of a router simulator will be implemented


# Nexts steps

- [x] Create Graph structure 

- [x] Implement  Dijkstra's algorithm

- [x] Test instance

- [ ] Create web application to show graph payload traffic
